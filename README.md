# 99_problems

Working through 99 OCaml problems (https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/99problems.html)

This is a simple project to get some practice writing in OCaml.
Written in a TDD style using `dune runtests` with inline tests using a `let%test _ = ...` style.

Given that the purpose is to try to get practical experience with OCaml, and I'm quite familiar
with functional programming techniques, I'm happy to use existing libraries where useful for auxiliary
things (particular datastructures, etc). I didn't use any libraries to outright solve a problem though.

I started plowing through in order but got a bit bored; now I'm jumping around looking at interesting problems.
